# TypeScript Express Backend 1 (TEB1)

This project was designed with developers in mind. Adding pages to the application is easier than ever.

To run this locally, simply clone it from the GitHub, install the packages using NPM by doing `npm install` in the terminal. To start the application, run `npm start`.

To experience the examples included in this template, try the following URLs

| Index Page          | localhost:3000/                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| About Page          | localhost:3000/about              |
| Full Employees API  | localhost:3000/api/employees      |
| Employee of index 0 | localhost:3000/api/employees?id=0 |
| Employee of index 1 | localhost:3000/api/employees?id=1 |

###### If you're running this on a different port, change localhost:3000 to localhost:(new port).

###### That goes for domains too, replace localhost with your custom domain.
