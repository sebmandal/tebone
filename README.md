ðŸ“¥ To experience the examples included in this template, try the following URLs

| What is this page?  | The URL to the page               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Index Page          | localhost:3000/                   |
| About Page          | localhost:3000/about              |
| Full Employees API  | localhost:3000/api/employees      |
| Employee of index 0 | localhost:3000/api/employees?id=0 |
| Employee of index 1 | localhost:3000/api/employees?id=1 |

###### If you're running this on a different port, change localhost:3000 to localhost:(new port).

###### That goes for domains too, replace localhost with your custom domain.
